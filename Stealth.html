      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>Stealth technology aims to reduce the detectability of aircraft by radar, infrared, visual, and other detection methods. It's a cornerstone of modern military aviation.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Real-World Examples</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>F-117 Nighthawk:</strong> The first operational stealth aircraft, used by the U.S. Air Force.</li>
        <li><strong>B-2 Spirit:</strong> Strategic stealth bomber with radar-absorbent materials and low-profile shape.</li>
        <li><strong>F-35 Lightning II:</strong> Multirole stealth fighter with advanced radar avoidance systems.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Scientific Principles</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Radar-absorbent materials (RAM)</li>
        <li>Shaping of the aircraft to deflect radar waves</li>
        <li>Heat signature reduction via exhaust cooling</li>
        <li>Minimization of radio and electronic emissions</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

      <h2>In Fiction</h2>
      <p>Stealth is often romanticized in media. In <em>Captain America: The Winter Soldier</em>, the Helicarriers employ full optical stealth, which remains far from current capabilities. <em>Mission: Impossible â€“ Ghost Protocol</em> features a stealth suit and disappearing car, showing exaggerated portrayals of electromagnetic cloaking. Real tech can't yet match these depictions.</p>
