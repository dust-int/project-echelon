<h2>Welcome to Project Echelon</h2>
      <p><strong>Project Echelon</strong> is a website dedicated exploring the cutting edge of aeronautics. From real-world hypersonic jets to sci-fi stealth spacecraft, we dive into the technologies transforming aviation today — and how they compare to what fiction has imagined.</p>
      <p><strong>Project Echelon</strong> is a deep dive into the evolving world of aeronautics. This independent study explores groundbreaking advancements in hypersonic flight, stealth technology, and drone systems—while comparing them to their often exaggerated or fantastical portrayals in film, television, and literature.</p>

      <h2>Purpose of the Project</h2>
      <p>Modern aeronautics plays a critical role in defense, surveillance, and even space exploration. Yet popular culture has shaped public perception through science fiction. By bridging technical research and narrative fiction, this project helps explain not only what is scientifically possible but also why some ideas remain purely imaginative.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>What You Will Learn</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The current state and potential future of hypersonic aircraft</li>
        <li>How stealth technology works and why it’s effective</li>
        <li>Different types of drones and their real-world applications</li>
        <li>Side-by-side comparisons of real tech and its science fiction portrayals</li>
      </ul>

    <section>
      <h2>Fiction Meets Reality</h2>
      <p>Examples from fiction include:</p>
<ul>
        <li><strong>Hypersonic Flight:</strong> Learn how speeds beyond Mach 5 are being achieved with experimental aircraft and scramjets.</li>
        <li><strong>Stealth Technology:</strong> Discover the science behind radar evasion and cloaking systems, both real and imagined.</li>
        <li><strong>Drones:</strong> Investigate how autonomous systems are revolutionizing modern warfare and logistics.</li>
        <li><strong>Fiction vs. Reality:</strong> See how books, movies, and games inspired (or exaggerated) real-world tech.</li>
        <li><strong>Hypersonics:</strong> The SR-72 "Darkstar" in <em>Top Gun: Maverick</em> as a fictional successor to the SR-71</li>
        <li><strong>Stealth:</strong> Wonder Woman's invisible jet and the Batwing in <em>The Dark Knight Rises</em></li>
        <li><strong>Drones:</strong> Autonomous Hunter-Killers in <em>The Terminator</em> or the surveillance drones in <em>Black Mirror</em></li>
</ul>
      <p>Each fictional example is examined in relation to actual engineering and tactical realities.</p>
