      <h2>Welcome to Project Echelon</h2>
      <p><strong>Project Echelon</strong> is a comprehensive exploration into the cutting-edge world of aeronautics. This independent study spans developments in hypersonic flight, stealth technology, and drone innovation, as well as their dramatic portrayals in science fiction and media.</p>

      <h2>Purpose of the Project</h2>
      <p>From military strategy to global connectivity, aviation technology is shaping the 21st century. Fiction frequently jumps ahead of what’s realistically achievable, but it often inspires innovation. This project unpacks how close we are to some of those imagined breakthroughs—and where the gaps still lie.</p>
      <p>By exploring these topics through both scientific evidence and popular media, we can better understand the real-world impact of imagination, and how today’s engineers are turning inspiration into reality.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>What You Will Learn</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The science behind vehicles traveling at Mach 5 and beyond, including propulsion systems and materials science</li>
        <li>How radar-evading materials and designs work in real life, with practical military applications</li>
        <li>Why drones are reshaping both commercial and military aviation, including delivery systems and AI control</li>
        <li>How stories from movies and books compare to factual aerospace advancements, and their influence on research funding</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Fiction Meets Reality</h2>
      <p>Examples from fiction include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Hypersonics:</strong> The SR-72 "Darkstar" from <em>Top Gun: Maverick</em>—a conceptual follow-up to the SR-71 Blackbird, blending real design cues from Lockheed Martin.</li>
        <li><strong>Stealth:</strong> Wonder Woman’s invisible jet and the Batwing from <em>The Dark Knight Rises</em>, featuring advanced cloaking and silent propulsion.</li>
        <li><strong>Drones:</strong> The autonomous Hunter-Killers in <em>The Terminator</em> or real-world analogues like DARPA’s Gremlins program.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Through these fictional lenses, we analyze what’s technologically viable and what remains science fantasy. This also includes examining emerging technologies like adaptive camouflage, swarming drones, and scramjet propulsion systems that could one day close the gap between fiction and reality.</p>
