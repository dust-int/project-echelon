      <h2>Welcome to Project Echelon</h2>
      <p><strong>Project Echelon</strong> is a digital exploration of cutting-edge aeronautic technologies and their portrayals in science fiction. Through deep research, comparisons, and expert insights, this project examines hypersonic flight, stealth, drones, and how fiction reflects—and sometimes distorts—reality.</p>

      <h3>About the Project</h3>
      <p>This independent study investigates the progression of aeronautical engineering, focusing on three primary fields:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Hypersonic Flight:</strong> Pushing the boundaries of speed and heat resistance.</li>
        <li><strong>Stealth Technology:</strong> Engineering near-invisibility through material science and radar dynamics.</li>
        <li><strong>Drones:</strong> Autonomous and remote systems shaping both civilian life and warfare.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>In addition to technical analysis, this project examines how media representations—such as those in <em>Top Gun: Maverick</em>, <em>Iron Man</em>, and <em>The Expanse</em>—align with or exaggerate reality. The deliverable is a fully interactive website designed like a virtual museum for easy exploration of this topic.</p>
