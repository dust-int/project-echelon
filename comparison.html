      <h2>The Gap Between Imagination and Engineering</h2>
      <p>Fictional portrayals of aviation often stretch or defy the laws of physics. In contrast, real-world aeronautics must obey strict aerodynamic principles and material limitations. Still, science fiction plays an important role in inspiring innovation.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>What Fiction Gets Right</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Autonomous flight and AI-driven decision-making are rapidly becoming standard features in UAVs and future aircraft.</li>
        <li>Stealth and radar evasion are key focuses of military aerospace development, with real systems rivaling their fictional counterparts.</li>
        <li>Hypersonic flight is actively being developed, with some prototypes surpassing Mach 5 speeds.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Where Fiction Exaggerates</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>True invisibility (e.g. cloaking) is still purely speculative; current stealth focuses on radar and thermal reduction.</li>
        <li>Unlimited power sources and perfect maneuverability are not achievable with todayâ€™s propulsion and control technologies.</li>
        <li>AI autonomy shown in films often ignores real-world limitations around ethics, programming complexity, and control.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Science Fiction's Role</h2>
      <p>Fiction inspires real-world scientists and engineers to aim higher. Even though the capabilities portrayed in media are exaggerated, they create aspirational goals that fuel research and discovery.</p>
