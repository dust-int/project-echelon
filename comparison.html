      <h2>Bridging Science Fiction and Aerospace</h2>
      <p>Science fiction has long inspired technological advancement. Many concepts portrayed in media push the limits of what's possible, influencing engineers, military strategists, and innovators.</p>

      <h2>Key Comparisons</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Hypersonic Vehicles:</strong> The SR-72 from <em>Top Gun: Maverick</em> draws from real Lockheed Martin designs but glosses over scramjet propulsion limits and extreme heating problems.</li>
        <li><strong>Stealth Technology:</strong> Fictional stealth jets can be fully invisible, such as Wonder Woman's jet, unlike real stealth, which only reduces detectability.</li>
        <li><strong>Drones:</strong> Drones in <em>The Terminator</em> operate with complete autonomy, while current UAVs are heavily monitored and remotely piloted.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Inspirational Influence</h2>
      <p>While science fiction sometimes exaggerates or misrepresents technology, it often sparks the curiosity that leads to scientific exploration. Engineers often cite media like <em>Star Trek</em>, <em>2001: A Space Odyssey</em>, and <em>Iron Man</em> as inspiration for real breakthroughs.</p>
