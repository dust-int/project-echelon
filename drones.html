      <h2>Drone Technology</h2>
      <p>Drones—also known as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)—have revolutionized aviation, warfare, surveillance, and even package delivery. With increasingly autonomous systems, drones are becoming a staple in both civilian and military contexts.</p>

      <h3>Development and Types</h3>
      <p>Drones come in many forms: fixed-wing, rotary-wing, nano, and hybrid designs. From quadcopters used by hobbyists to massive surveillance drones like the RQ-4 Global Hawk, their roles have vastly expanded in the past decade.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Military:</strong> MQ-9 Reaper drones conduct surveillance and precision strikes with minimal risk to pilots.</li>
        <li><strong>Civilian:</strong> Drones are used for photography, agriculture, inspection, and delivery by companies like Amazon.</li>
        <li><strong>Emergency Services:</strong> Firefighters and search-and-rescue teams use drones to navigate dangerous environments.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Technological Innovations</h3>
      <p>Modern drones integrate GPS, obstacle avoidance, real-time imaging, and artificial intelligence. Swarm drone technology—where multiple drones act as a coordinated unit—is being tested for both tactical and civilian uses.</p>

      <h3>Challenges</h3>
      <p>Drone technology faces several limitations, including flight time (battery life), security risks, regulatory concerns, and ethical debates around privacy and autonomous weaponry.</p>

      <h3>Fictional Portrayals</h3>
      <p>Science fiction often depicts drones with highly advanced AI, unlimited power supplies, and near-invisibility. Films such as <em>Spider-Man: Far From Home</em> show weaponized drone swarms capable of illusions and high-impact attacks. Games like <em>Call of Duty</em> and <em>Watch Dogs</em> feature drones as omnipresent surveillance and combat tools.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Fiction:</strong> Autonomous decision-making, infinite flight time, instant response capabilities.</li>
        <li><strong>Reality:</strong> Limited by battery life, require human oversight, and subject to malfunction and jamming.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Future Trends</h3>
      <p>Looking ahead, drone development is focusing on improved autonomy, increased range, and integration with AI for smarter navigation. Urban air mobility (UAM) concepts envision drone taxis and delivery systems reshaping city logistics. Counter-drone systems are also growing in importance to protect sensitive areas from unwanted UAVs.</p>
