      <h2>What is Hypersonic Flight?</h2>
      <p>Hypersonic flight refers to speeds exceeding Mach 5 (five times the speed of sound). These speeds introduce unique challenges, including extreme heat, shockwave formation, and advanced materials needed to withstand aerodynamic forces.</p>

      <h2>Current Developments</h2>
      <p>Modern programs such as the U.S. Air Force's Hypersonic Attack Cruise Missile (HACM) and DARPA's Glide Breaker are examples of real-world hypersonic efforts. Nations like China and Russia have also tested systems like the DF-ZF and Avangard.</p>
      <p>Hypersonic vehicles typically fall into two categories: boost-glide systems and scramjet-powered craft. NASAâ€™s X-43 and X-51 were experimental aircraft used to study scramjet technology.</p>

      <h2>Fictional Depictions</h2>
      <p>In <em>Top Gun: Maverick</em>, the SR-72 "Darkstar" represents a fictional hypersonic aircraft inspired by real Lockheed Martin concepts. While visually compelling, the film simplifies the complexities of propulsion and thermal management.</p>
