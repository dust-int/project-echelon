      <h2>How Stealth Works</h2>
      <p>Stealth technology aims to make aircraft less detectable to radar, infrared, visual, and other detection methods. Key strategies include radar-absorbing materials, angular surfaces that deflect radar waves, and heat masking techniques.</p>

      <h2>Modern Applications</h2>
      <p>Examples of real-world stealth aircraft include the B-2 Spirit, F-22 Raptor, and F-35 Lightning II. These aircraft use a combination of shape, materials, and electronic warfare systems to reduce detectability.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>Fictional Examples</h2>
      <p>In fiction, stealth aircraft are often exaggerated with features like full invisibility. The Batwing in <em>The Dark Knight Rises</em> and Wonder Womanâ€™s invisible jet are examples. While these concepts are not currently possible, they reflect the desire for total sensor evasion.</p>

      <h2>Limitations</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Limited maneuverability due to design constraints</li>
        <li>High maintenance and cost</li>
        <li>Only effective against specific radar bands</li>
        <li>Compromised stealth when weapons bays are open</li>
      </ul>
