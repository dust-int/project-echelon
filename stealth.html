      <h2>Stealth Technology</h2>
      <p>Stealth technology, often associated with invisibility, is more accurately described as the reduction of an object's visibility to detection systems. It marks a revolutionary shift in military strategy, emphasizing evasion and survivability over brute strength. It includes a mix of shape design, materials science, and thermal and acoustic suppression.</p>

      <h3>How It Works</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Radar-Absorbent Materials (RAM):</strong> Used to absorb rather than reflect radar waves. These materials convert radar energy into heat.</li>
        <li><strong>Shaping:</strong> Aircraft are designed with faceted surfaces or curves to deflect radar waves away from their source. This includes non-perpendicular edges, internal weapon bays, and angled tails.</li>
        <li><strong>Heat and Acoustic Suppression:</strong> Infrared signature is reduced by shielding exhaust ports or mixing hot gases with cooler air. Some designs also incorporate quiet engines to reduce acoustic detection.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Real-World Examples</h3>
      <p>Modern stealth aircraft represent decades of research. Here are notable examples:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>F-117 Nighthawk:</strong> The first operational stealth aircraft, used by the U.S. Air Force during the Gulf War. Famous for its angular shape and radar-deflecting design.</li>
        <li><strong>B-2 Spirit:</strong> A long-range stealth bomber with a flying wing design. Capable of carrying nuclear and conventional weapons while avoiding radar detection.</li>
        <li><strong>F-22 Raptor and F-35 Lightning II:</strong> These next-gen fighters combine stealth with speed and agility, using RAM, internal weapon bays, and low-drag designs.</li>
        <li><strong>B-21 Raider (upcoming):</strong> Expected to enhance stealth with modular systems and next-gen material sciences.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Stealth in Fiction</h3>
      <p>Popular media often pushes stealth capabilities beyond realistic limits. These representations can inspire curiosity but also mislead audiences about what is scientifically possible:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Invisible Jet (Wonder Woman):</strong> An aircraft that is entirely invisible to all detection methods. While RAM and shaping reduce radar visibility, true invisibility remains fictional.</li>
        <li><strong>The Batwing:</strong> In Batman's films and games, this aircraft often appears and vanishes seamlessly. Real aircraft require significant technological trade-offs that limit such invisibility.</li>
        <li><strong>Die Another Day (James Bond):</strong> Features a car and aircraft with adaptive camouflage or "invisibility cloaks." While metamaterials and optical cloaking are studied, they remain impractical on large, moving objects.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Challenges and Limitations</h3>
      <p>Stealth technology has its constraints:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Radar Advancement:</strong> New multi-static radar arrays and low-frequency radars can detect objects once considered invisible.</li>
        <li><strong>Trade-offs:</strong> Stealth often means sacrificing internal space, speed, or aerodynamics. For instance, the F-117 could not fly in daylight due to its visibility and lacked maneuverability.</li>
        <li><strong>Cost and Maintenance:</strong> Stealth coatings are expensive and delicate, requiring frequent repair.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Future Outlook</h3>
      <p>Looking ahead, stealth may evolve in several ways:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Metamaterials:</strong> Scientists are exploring materials that bend electromagnetic waves, potentially creating optical cloaking.</li>
        <li><strong>Active Camouflage:</strong> Systems that adjust surface visuals based on the environment, mimicking surroundings like a chameleon.</li>
        <li><strong>Drone Swarms:</strong> Future air dominance may rely on groups of small, low-observable drones coordinated by AI, overwhelming detection systems.</li>
      </ul>
